        <p>In computing, JavaScript (/ˈdʒævəˌskrɪpt/[5]) is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language.[6]
          It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.[7] Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one
          of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it, and all
          modern Web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins.[6] JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class
          functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented,[8] imperative, and functional programming
          styles.[6] It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any
          I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which
          it is embedded.[7]<code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository

          and CSS
        </h3>
        <h4>HTML</h4>
        <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.[1]
          Web browsers receive HTML documents from a webserver or from local storage and render them into multimedia web
          pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance
          of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects,
          such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents
          by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML
          elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
        <h4>CSS</h4>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written
          in a markup language.[1] Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written
          in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable
          to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used
          by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces
          for many mobile applications.[2] CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document
          presentation, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility,
          provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML
          pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition
          in the structural content.</p>

          Data driven documentation</h3>

        <p>D3 allows you to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations
          to the document. For example, you can use D3 to generate an HTML table from an array of numbers. Or, use the same
          data to create an interactive SVG bar chart with smooth transitions and interaction. D3 is not a monolithic framework
          that seeks to provide every conceivable feature. Instead, D3 solves the crux of the problem: efficient manipulation
          of documents based on data. This avoids proprietary representation and affords extraordinary flexibility, exposing
          the full capabilities of web standards such as HTML, SVG, and CSS. With minimal overhead, D3 is extremely fast,
          supporting large datasets and dynamic behaviors for interaction and animation. D3’s functional style allows code
          reuse through a diverse collection of components and plugins.</p>
